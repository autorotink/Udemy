After a job interview, I realize that I should definitely get some coding in my toolbelt! I do know a little bit of things like Bash (which I learned through a little bit of Red Hat Training!)

**Day 1:** Today we covered foundational concepts like printing, variables, f-strings, tuple unpacking, and commenting. The day also introduced tools like PyCharm and Thonny, emphasized debugging strategies, and culminated in building a fun Band Name Generator project.
